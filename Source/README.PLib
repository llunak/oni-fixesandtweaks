A copy of part of PLib from https://github.com/peterhaneve/ONIMods is included.

PLib docs suggest to use ILMerge, but I have no idea how to use it on Linux,
and also the repo is now read-only, so possibly obsolete. Copying the libs
here and compiling them directly should have the same result.

Changes:
Removed *.csproj files.
Removed AssemblyInfo.cs files.
Fixed warnings.
